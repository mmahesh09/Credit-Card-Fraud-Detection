# Credit Card Fraud Detection: CardRaksha

Credit card fraud is a major global issue that incurs significant financial losses. This project leverages machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns and anomalies in transaction data. Using techniques like supervised learning, anomaly detection, and neural networks, the model classifies transactions as legitimate or fraudulent with high accuracy. Key challenges include handling imbalanced datasets, adapting to evolving fraud tactics, and ensuring real-time detection. By implementing scalable and efficient algorithms, the project aims to minimize financial risks, reduce false positives, and improve detection speed, offering a robust solution for securing financial systems against fraud.
## Features

1. ## Real-time Fraud Detection
Description: CardRaksha uses advanced machine learning algorithms and data analytics to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. By analyzing transaction patterns, the system can flag suspicious activities instantly, allowing quick intervention to prevent financial loss.

2. ## AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
Description: The project leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models (such as decision trees, neural networks, or ensemble methods) to recognize patterns of normal transactions and detect anomalies. These models continuously learn from new data to improve fraud detection accuracy over time.

3. ## Enhanced Security and Privacy
Description: CardRaksha emphasizes secure data handling and privacy by implementing robust encryption techniques and anonymizing sensitive transaction details. The project ensures that user data remains confidential while offering high accuracy in detecting fraudulent activities.
