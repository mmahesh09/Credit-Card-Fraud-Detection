# Credit Card Fraud Detection: CardRaksha üí≥



Credit card fraud causes huge financial losses worldwide. This project uses machine learning to identify fraudulent transactions by finding unusual patterns in the data. The model will classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent using methods like supervised learning and anomaly detection. Key challenges include dealing with unbalanced data, keeping up with new fraud methods, and making quick, real-time predictions. By using efficient algorithms, the goal is to reduce financial losses, improve accuracy, and detect fraud quickly to protect financial systems.

## Features ‚ôªÔ∏è

1. ### Real-time Fraud Detection
   CardRaksha uses advanced machine learning algorithms and data analytics to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. By analyzing transaction patterns, the system can flag suspicious activities instantly, allowing quick intervention to prevent financial loss.

2. ### AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
   The project leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models (such as decision trees, neural networks, or ensemble methods) to recognize patterns of normal transactions and detect anomalies. These models continuously learn from new data to improve fraud detection accuracy over time.

3. ### Enhanced Security and Privacy
   CardRaksha emphasizes secure data handling and privacy by implementing robust encryption techniques and anonymizing sensitive transaction details. The project ensures that user data remains confidential while offering high accuracy in detecting fraudulent activities.

## Dataset üìÇ

The dataset contains 10,000 entries with six columns: **Profession**, **Income**, **Credit_card_number**, **Expiry**, **Security_code**, and **Fraud**.

- **Profession** (categorical) indicates the individual's occupation.
- **Income** (numerical) shows the annual income.
- **Credit_card_number**, **Expiry**, and **Security_code** are sensitive details associated with credit card information.

- **Fraud** (binary) is the target variable indicating whether fraud occurred (1 for fraud, 0 for no fraud).

The dataset appears to focus on detecting fraudulent transactions or behavior based on personal and financial details. It contains no missing values, and the data types are correctly assigned. However, the 
presence of sensitive information like credit card numbers suggests the need for privacy-preserving analysis. Further exploration is required to understand the distribution of fraud cases and relationships 
between features.
