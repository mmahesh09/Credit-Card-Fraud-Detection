# Credit Card Fraud Detection


Credit card fraud is a major global issue that incurs significant financial losses. This project leverages machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns and anomalies in transaction data. Using techniques like supervised learning, anomaly detection, and neural networks, the model classifies transactions as legitimate or fraudulent with high accuracy. Key challenges include handling imbalanced datasets, adapting to evolving fraud tactics, and ensuring real-time detection. By implementing scalable and efficient algorithms, the project aims to minimize financial risks, reduce false positives, and improve detection speed, offering a robust solution for securing financial systems against fraud.

Features:
  1) Preprocessing of imbalanced datasets.
  2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns.
  3) Implementation of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
  4) Evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
  5) Deployment-ready code for real-time fraud detection.

Future Work
  1) Implement advanced techniques like deep learning with autoencoders.
  2) Explore anomaly detection algorithms.
  3) Integrate the system with real-time transaction systems.
